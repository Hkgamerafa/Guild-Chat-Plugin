# ROTMG Guild Chat Discord Plugin
Bring your Realm of the Mad God guild closer together by bridging in-game chat with Discord with a subscription-based community plug-in that ties Realm of the Mad God guild chat to a Discord text channel and vice-versa.

### What the service does:
 - Relays in-game guild chat messages to your guild's Discord server in real time.
 - Relays Discord channel messages back into the in-game guild chat with a simple slash command.
 - Keeps your guild connected, even outside the game.
 - Runs quietly and reliably in the background with minimal guild overhead.

### How it works:
 1. A bot account joins your guild in-game. This account can be provided by the guild with a name of their liking if access to an existing account is granted.
 2. The guild provides a discord channel webhook that the plugin will use to push in-game guild chat messages to the dedicated text channel.
 3. A discord bot is added to the guild and assiged basic permissions to the dedicated text channel. It relays messages sent in the text channel to the guild chat in-game.
 4. Messages flow both ways, guild to Discord and Discord to guild, reliably and with minimal footprint. Your guild and extended members are now able to interact also outside of the game.
